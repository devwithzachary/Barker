# Barker - A Serverless Twitter Clone

Barker is a simple twitter style social network written to demostrate the serverless services provided by Huawei's AppGallery Connect platform.

This app is written during live streams over at https://www.twitch.tv/devwithzachary
The streams are then edited down into videos which you can watch https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC63PqG8ZnWC4JWYrNJKocMA 

Finally there is also a written copy of the guide found on dev.to https://dev.to/devwithzachary

Each episodes code is commited as a single commit to make it easy to step along with the code, simply checkout the specific commit and follow along!
